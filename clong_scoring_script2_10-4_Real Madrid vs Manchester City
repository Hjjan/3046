Men: camavinga shimmy away from grealish. Big deflection. Read Madrid level. Edurado camavinga. Seizes his moment. little drop of the shoulder to get the movement away that he needed from grealish.

Women: it’s a big deflection, isn’t it? Off Dias as he comes in. you know it’s great initial play from camavinga, say little drop of the shoulder, gets him away from grealish.
