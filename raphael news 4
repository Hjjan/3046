'It's fake news' - Atletico Madrid striker's entourage on Dani Alves' bail
The entourage of Atlético Madrid's striker Memphis Depay commented on his involvement in providing bail for Dani Alves.
Former right-back Dani Alves was released on bail after paying one million euros. However, Alves himself couldn't raise such an amount due to debts and frozen accounts. Memphis Depay, the Atlético striker, assisted Dani Alves, having formed a bond with the Brazilian footballer during their time together at Barcelona.
According to Football Espana, Depay and Alves were friends, but Sebastian Ladur, the representative of the Dutch footballer, denied this, stating that it was "fake news" - "This is fake news, it's completely untrue."
It is noteworthy to recall that Dani Alves was found guilty of assaulting a 23-year-old woman in the restroom of a prestigious nightclub in Barcelona, although the footballer claims the encounter was consensual. The woman alleges that Alves attacked her and then struck her. He was sentenced to 4.5 years of imprisonment.
