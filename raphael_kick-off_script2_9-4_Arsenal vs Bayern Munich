[9/4 Arsenal vs Bayern Munich] {0:00}
Bayern Munich certainly could but they’ve got the experience here they’ve got the big match mentality it’s all about the Champions League.
Jesus and they are in such outstanding shape. Musiala and Coman are back from injury to feature amongst the substitute.
Bayern Munich is ready and away we go the quarterfinals of the UEFA Champions League in 2023-24.
