[10/4 PSG vs Barcelona] {0:0}
So whatever we see tonight whatever happens nothing definitive here however what a great game to go and win particularly for the home team I feel. 
Who is setting a new club record tonight with his 436 Paris appearance.And Lamine Yamal is only 16 and Ikay Gundogan in midfield.
Luis Eniquire did rest his regulars for the league game here on Saturday against the bottom club CL they needed a late equalizer to get a point but they are pulling away.
