Trump Congratulates Putin On Landslide Victory Hours Before Polls Open
Former U.S. President Donald J. Trump took time out from his own presidential campaign tonight to congratulate Vladimir Putin on his “landslide” election win, hours before voting began in Russia.

Describing the 2024 Russian presidential election results as “very impressive,” Trump congratulated Putin on an “honorable campaign run” and victory.

“The results of the Russian election speak for themselves,” Trump posted, alongside a picture of Ronald Reagan. “I’ve never seen numbers go so high! Triple digits! Almost as high as in my stolen election!”

Later, speaking to Fox News, Trump spoke glowingly of the entire Russian election process. “Honestly, they have this wonderful tradition in Russia where everyone comes together to celebrate their new leader while lining up to vote. It’s a wonderful thing, and it’s something I’d love to see here soon.”

Trump also paid tribute to Putin’s presidential rivals, saying, “They fought bravely,” before mourning their untimely deaths from separate window-related incidents.
