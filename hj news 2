Antetokounmpo Leads Bucks To Title With Perfect Stat Line
Thanasis Antetokounmpo defied all odds in route to helping the Bucks win their first NBA Championship in 50 years last night. The "Greek Freak", who some have compared to Shaquille O'Neal, recorded what some in the industry are calling, a "PERFECT" stat line.

Not even the great Michael Jordan ever recorded a 0/0/0 stat line during his historic run in the NBA Finals back in the 90's. It remains to be seen whether Thanasis will live up to the hype and surpass Jordan as the Greatest Player of All Time, but he now has accomplished at least one thing MJ never did.

Thanasis was happy his little brother Giannis, who also plays for the Bucks, got to experience the moment with him. The two are very excited to head to Disney World after the celebrations cease.
