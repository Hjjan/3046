Men: it was build as a game that was always going to be wide open. It is every bit of that. Here is Vinicius junior bearing down. that will beat Ortega. It’s Rodrigo to score another. two one real Madrid. What a turn around. Carlo can barely believe it, Rodrigo sent through and he raced away
Women: well you could see the pass, couldn’t you? Of Rodrigo on the left-hand side. I think it’s a mistake from Ortega. I think he can do better there. But he does well. Once he gets ahead of the defense, he just then cut in towards goal. He’s got one thing on his mind, which just originate from the goalkeeper. Manchester city will be disappointed how easily real Madrid get in. this is a great ball. Time is run to perfection.
