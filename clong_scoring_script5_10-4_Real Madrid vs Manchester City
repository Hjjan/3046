Men: Grealish. Which way this time? Inside. Gvardiol !!! nobody saw that coming. his first goal for Manchester city. In a game like this. Scored like that. It’s a wonder strike from the Croatian defender. And Manchester city, for the first time since 12th minute back in front of the tie
Women: what a strike this is guys. It’s absolutely brilliant. Jack grealish does well on the left-hand side. Is he going to go down the line? is he going to cut back inside? cut back inside, plays it to Gvardiol. His first touch out of his feet and then look at the whip on that, to get that into the far corner. Fantastic ability there.
