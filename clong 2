After letting the football media run wild with reporting and speculation, the France international set the record straight over whether he wants out of PSG following the 1-0 win in Le Classique against Olympique de Marseille. 

“I’m very happy, I never asked to leave in January,” Mbappé told reporters (h/t RMC Sport). “The info came out on the day of the match [against Benfica], I didn’t understand. I’m not not even remotely involved in this news. I was just as shocked as everyone else. 

“People may think I’m involved, but I’m not involved at all; I was taking a nap. My entourage was at my little brother’s game. All the people who take care of me weren’t there, so we were flabbergasted when we found out. Afterward, we had to deal with it; there was a game to play. Just to say it’s completely wrong, and I’m very happy.”Mbappé is under contract for two more seasons plus an option for a third and is the face of the project at PSG. Furthermore, the capital club brought in an executive he and his family trust, Luis Campos, to serve as the sporting advisor.

Campos didn’t bring everything that the French giants still need, such as a center-back and No. 9 striker, but the Portuguese club chief did overhaul the midfield, one of the key weaknesses over the last few years. 

There’s still the January transfer window for Campos to address any key liabilities in the squad to prepare for the UEFA Champions League knockout stages.
