[6/3 Bayern Munich vs Lazio] {0:0}
 And the supporters have quickly forgotten last season’s exploits .
Runners up in Seria A and that’s what got them into the Champions League and Leroy Sane is set to play through the pain of an injured knee, declare himself ok to return in place of Matty’s tae. 
The Talis man at the top he comes back in for Tatti Castellanos.
It is going to be Lazio to get the game started, one nil up from the first leg, the best they’ve managed in the Champions League is the quarterfinals, that was their first season in the competition back in 1999-2000, they’re halfway there tonight.
