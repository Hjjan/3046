British actor Rowan Atkinson, who became a household name for his portrayal of comic character 'Mr Bean', became a victim of fake news after reports emerged on social media that he died on Tuesday morning.

Rumours began doing the rounds that Rowan Atkinson died in a car accident. The report first emerged on a fake Twitter account of Fox News. "Mr Bean (Rowan Atkinson) died at 58 after (a) car accident," the tweet read.

However, Rowan Atkinson is actually 66 years old. It didn't take much time for the Twitteratti to figure out that the news was false and 'Mr Bean' was alive.

This is not the first time that Atkinson has fallen prey to a death hoax. In 2016, a Facebook page titled "RIP Rowan Atkinson" claimed that the actor was found unconscious at his home.
